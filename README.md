A simple game that utilises the LÃ–VE framework

Aim of this small game is to use create something using the knowledge that I acquired from a love2d tutorial and put it into practice.

The game should resemble another popular game, be intuitive to play and should support a handful of essential features.
The readme will be updated when these features have been implemented.
